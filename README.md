# MyPortfolio

My personal portfolio. Features a JavaScript client and CMS which consumes a Spring Boot RESTful API backend. Also includes a automated building, testing and deployment.

I've added the code to GitHub, sans sensitive configuration files, so that prospective employers, clients and colleagues can have a snoop around my code.
